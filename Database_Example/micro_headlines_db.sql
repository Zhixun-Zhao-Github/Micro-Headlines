As the sister model of ET5, the combination of ET5T and ET5 can quickly open up the market below 300,000 yuan.\n\nThere are traces of this approach: Tesla has practiced it on Model Y and achieved great success.\n\nModel Y and Model 3 share the same platform, with a parts reuse rate of up to 75%, and a sharp drop in R&D costs. Although Model Y was initially complained by users as an enlarged version of Model 3, it is undeniable that Model Y does solve the user\'s complaints about the lack of space in Model 3.\n\nHowever, the most critical thing is that the price of Model Y is low enough, which directly lowers the purchase threshold of Tesla, giving those consumers who are sensitive to price and hesitate whether to spend an extra 40,000 or 50,000 yuan a sufficient reason.\n\nNIO ET5T is facing the competition with Tesla in a way that has been verified by the market. But at the same time, NIO ET5T is approaching and surpassing Tesla Model Y in terms of intelligence, space performance, design and product strength.\n\nNIO ET5T, a substitute for Tesla Model Y?\n\nFor small families with a budget of about 300,000 yuan, which pure electric vehicle will consumers choose?\n\nThe feedback from the global market is that Tesla Model Y is a compact SUV. In 2022, Model Y\'s global sales will be 747,000 units, and its sales in China will be 315,000 units, accounting for about 42.2% of its global share.\n\nAccording to the size of the model, SUVs can be divided into four categories: large, medium, small, and compact. According to the price, SUVs can be divided into practical, economical, mid-to-high-end, luxury, and super luxury.\n\nModel Y is far ahead in the mid-to-high-end SUV market segment, and it can be said that there is no opponent. Because whether it is Mercedes-Benz EQC, BMW iX3, or the domestic BYD Tang EV, etc., compared with Model Y, they cannot pose a threat to it. Both Mercedes-Benz EQC and BMW iX3 are \"oil-to-electric\" models, and they are not real electric vehicles. BYD\'s intelligent capabilities are far inferior to Tesla\'s. The core modules of the cockpit and intelligent driving are still from the supplier\'s solution, not self-developed.\n\nLeifeng.com believes that before, among the domestic independent brands, only Weilai\'s ES6 can compete with Model Y. However, the average price of ES6 is much higher than that of Model Y, and the price difference between the entry-level versions of the two is about 100,000. But after Weilai launched ET5T, the situation will inevitably reverse.',4,5,0,'2023-06-25 09:44:20','2024-06-08 10:20:00',0),
